* Description

  This package provide basic access to [[http://dslsrv2.eecs.missouri.edu/~zlht3/ss][MUFOLD]] server. You can send sequences to server and take back information about secondary structure. The server limitations is: 10 sequences at one request and each sequence no longer than 1000 amino acids in length. You can information about your job using this [[http://dslsrv2.eecs.missouri.edu/~zlht3/ss/myjob][link]]. 

* Install 
  For install you can use devtools:

  #+BEGIN_SRC R
  library(devtools)
  install_github("mpyatkov/aatoss")
  #+END_SRC

* Usage 
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    library(aatoss)

    email = "test11@test.com"
    testseq <- data.frame(target = c("fasta_seq1", "fasta_seq2"),
                          fasta  = c("RDPHPAPPRTSQEPHQNPHGVIPSESKPFVASKPKPHT",
                                     "PSLPRPPGCPAQQGGSAPIDPPPVHESPHPPLPATEPA"),
                          stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

    # send sequences to server
    sequences <- sendToServer(testseq, email)

    # wait a couple of minutes, 1 sequence ~ 1-2 minutes of calculation
    # ...

    # retrive results from server ( only finished sequences )
    structures <- getResultsFromServer(sequences)

    # or you can obtain all finished sequences which associated with this email
    all.structures <- getAllResultsFromServer(email)
  #+END_SRC
